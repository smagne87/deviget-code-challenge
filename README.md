# Description

On this project you will find different implementations because I wanted to show how flexible I am when working on projects.

I use stateless and class components, redux with thunks but I'm also good with hooks. Regarding styles, you will also notice different approaches, I used classes defined in JS (based on Material UI documentation) and also sass.

# Run the Project

After clone the repo, run `npm install` then copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` then `npm start` and enjoy.
